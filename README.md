# Lab-11

This *github* repository contains Lab 11 for GSM 5103.  There are two primary pieces of R code in operation, at present.

1. *DataandPacks.R* houses the data utilized in the various exercises for assessing functional forms individually and then turning to the Fresh problem.
2.  *PackInstaller.R* installs the packages that are `require`d by the data file to set up the items that we use.

The exercise involves the use of linear regression for polynomials in bivariate and multiple regression problems applied to cost accounting and demand forecasting.
